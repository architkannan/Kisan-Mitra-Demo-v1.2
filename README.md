# Kisan Mitra Demo Dashboard

Kisan Mitra is a helpline that helps farmers get easy access to information on government schemes, farming advice, financial guidance, and personal support. Its objective is to make it simpler for farmers to find timely help for their issues and improve their overall well-being.

This demo dashboard for Kisan Mitra was built with **Python** using Streamlit.

## Overview

Kisan Mitra currently operates in select districts of Telangana. The long-term goal is to scale this model across other states as a leading framework for farmer support, information delivery, and problem resolution.

To achieve this goal, it is critical to identify, analyze, and track key metrics, such as the types of calls received and whether they are resolved within the timelines set by the respective SLAs.

## Data Sources

Kisan Mitra uses ERPNext as a core platform to record call interaction details with farmers. 

This demo project uses three static datasets from ERPNext, covering the period May 2018 to May 2025.
