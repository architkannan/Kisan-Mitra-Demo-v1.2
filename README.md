# Kisan Mitra Demo Dashboard

***A Streamlit dashboard to track and visualize farmer helpline interactions to identify delays in support delivery and improve offline resolution processes.***

### ❗ The Problem
- Farmers struggle to access relevant and timely information on government schemes, farming advice, financial guidance, and personal support.    
- ***Kisan Mitra***, a helpline for farmers operating in Telangana, with plans to scale, needed a way to **monitor helpline performance and issue resolution**.  
- **Key gaps**: poor visibility into issue types, resolution performance, and adherence to Kisan Mitra’s defined timelines.


### ✅ The Solution
I built a demo **Streamlit dashboard** (for demonstration; not deployed to production) that:
- Tracks key operational metrics (cases registered, resolved, and aging of open issues).  
- Highlights patterns and recurring issues so they can be analyzed further offline. 
- Uses static ERPNext datasets (May 2018 – May 2025).  

### 🌟 Impact
- Improves visibility into farmer support operations and key performance metrics  
- Enables faster troubleshooting of delays in issue resolution  
- Supports data-driven planning for scaling Kisan Mitra to additional states  

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- CSV (ERPNext exports)  

### 📊 Key Metrics
- Total cases registered  
- Total cases resolved  
- Resolution rate (%)  
- Average resolution time (days)  
- Non-resolved closed cases  
- Aging of pending cases (<7, 7–30, >30 days)
